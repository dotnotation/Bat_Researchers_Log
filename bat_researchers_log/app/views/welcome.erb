      <h3>Welcome to the Bat Researchers' Log! </h3>
      <p>The goal of this application is to help researchers from all over the world to communicate about the bats that they are researching. Hopefully with this tool we can save better understand bat patterns.
        Given the infectious nature of White Nose Syndrome, this tool can also help us track the disease better and hopefully create a cure to save the species of bats that are more susceptible.</p>
      <p>Even without an account you can look at our list of bats <a class="button" href="/bats">here.</a> If you would like to edit or add your own information, please log in or create an account. </p>
      <p>This logging tool is currently being developed and any feedback on how to improve this app is welcomed.</p>
