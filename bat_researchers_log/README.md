Bat Researchers' Log is a sinatra web application that stores information about bats that researchers are documenting. This is a web application using the concepts of MVC.
 
Any visitor can see data about bats. Users who have an account can log bats and make edits to their own bats.
 
<h3>Why Bats?</h3>
I have been passionate about bats for a long time. Bats have been dying off due to a terrible disease called White Nose Syndrome. The disease is usually fatal and is considered one of the worst wildlife diseases of modern history. The first documented case of the disease was in 2007. There is still no cure or real treatment. It spreads rapidly and can kill an entire colony. Basically it is their COVID-19 but there is no vaccine and it has been going on for a much longer period of time. Speaking of COVID-19, many people have wrongfully blamed bats and are now killing bats. Some people have destroyed entire colonies of bats. Bats need to be protected, now more than ever. 
 
Bats are nocturnal pollinators that the world desperately needs. Take for instance the agave plant. The agave plant has evolved to co-exist with the bats that pollinate it. Without bats, the agave plant ceases to exist. 300 species of fruit are exclusively pollinated by bats. Just think about how many amazing things we would be missing in our world without bats.
